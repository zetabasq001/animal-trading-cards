			<p class="description">The Royal Python is a species of python that is primarily 
				terresterial and a non-venomous constrictor that preys on small mammals. 
				It has a defense strategy when stressed to curl into a ball with its 
				head and neck positioned in its center; hence, the reason why it is also 
				called the Ball Python.
